            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                    <li> <a>Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values -imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with uniquenames. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                    </li>

                    <li> <a>Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x=10;
                    </li>

                    <li><a>Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to conceptl to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives . Boolean - true or false; null- null aka nothing; Number-42 or 3.14159; String- "Coding Dojo Rocks"!; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object- {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values values or condtionthat have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condtion is true, do this code in our block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    </li>

                    }
